"""Contrave combines drugs that were used for alcohol, smoking, and opioid cessation. People lose weight on it because it also helps control over-eating. I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two. I&#039;m hoping that after a few months on this medication, I will develop healthier habits that I can continue without the aid of Contrave."""
"""I have been on this birth control for one cycle. After reading some of the reviews on this type and similar birth controls I was a bit apprehensive to start. Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping! I had unprotected sex the first month and obviously didn&#039;t get pregnant so I&#039;m very pleased! Highly recommend"""
"""4 days in on first 2 weeks.  Using on arms and face. Put vaseline on lips, under eyes and in nostrils to protect from cream.  So far no reaction at all.  I know I have many pre cancer and thought I would light up like a Christmas tree but so far so good.  Maybe it&#039;s coming but time will tell."""
"""The Drug was ok"""
"""This has been great for me. I&#039;ve been on it for 2 weeks and in the last week I only had 3 headaches which went away with 2 Tylenol. I was having chronic daily headaches that wouldn&#039;t go away no matter what I took. I&#039;m still a little sleepy during the day, but I know that will get better. I take 10mg at night."""

I am at 3 mgs and really starting to feel the withdraw.I don&#039;t plan to get my next 30 doses.because its almost rediculous how little it does for me. I have 3 does doses of 3 mg and Im terrified. Can anyone give me some truthful encouragement?....."""
"""I was on this pill for almost two years. It does work as far as not getting pregnant however my experience at first was it didn&#039;t make a huge difference then 6 or 7 months into it my sex drive went down, along with being very very dry, my moodiness increased drastically. I would cry one second and then get angry with my husband over anything and everything. My skin has gotten a lot worse, I broke out in places I never had in the last week. So now I am on Yaz."""
"""A doctor in the ER prescribed me 200 mg of Provigil when I was first diagnosed with Narcolepsy. It didn&#039;t seem to have any effect on me at all. Then I went to see my sleep doctor and he prescribed me 250 mg of Nuvigil. It finally allowed me to stay awake for an entire day. But if I went out somewhere I would be able to come home and take a nap and be fully awake again. Taking that with Xyrem makes me feel 98%..not quite 100, but still pretty great."""

"""Holy Hell is exactly how I feel. I had been taking Brisdelle for 1.5 years. The hot flashes did indeed subside - however, the side affects of this medicine coupled with the fact Noven was acquired by YET another pharmaceutical company - YOU CAN&#039;T PLACE A REP IN THE AREA, DISTRIBUTE YOUR DRUGS, AND THEN FIRE HER-AND NOT REPLACE THEREFORE there is NO medicine or support here. You dumped this drug in the Dr&#039;s hands and walked away. After calling Sebula - you act like you don&#039;t even care. You have made it impossible to obtain this. I happen to think this is illegal.  I just decided to wean myself off this and Premarin. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. If you don&#039;t need this drug- DON&#039;T START. Seriously."""
